=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Tundra (Auto-Claude)
Task: OAuth callback does not verify CSRF state parameter
Workspace: /Users/studio/tundra/.auto-claude/worktrees/tasks/001-oauth-callback-does-not-verify-csrf-state-paramete
Started: 2026-02-28

Workflow Type: investigation
Rationale: This task was created from a security ideation item (sec-001) describing a critical CSRF vulnerability
in the GitHub OAuth callback endpoint. The spec stated that the callback endpoint never verifies the state parameter,
allowing potential CSRF attacks. However, during Phase 0 investigation, it was discovered that this vulnerability
has ALREADY BEEN FIXED in the current codebase.

===========================
INVESTIGATION FINDINGS
===========================

Status: ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

The spec describes a vulnerability where:
  - OAuth authorize endpoint generates a state token (UUID)
  - OAuth callback endpoint DOES NOT verify the state
  - This allows CSRF attacks

However, investigation of the current codebase reveals:

✅ State Generation (crates/at-bridge/src/http_api/github.rs:525)
   - UUID v4 generated in github_oauth_authorize
   - State stored with timestamp in ApiState.oauth_pending_states

✅ State Validation (crates/at-bridge/src/http_api/github.rs:546-583)
   - Callback extracts state from request body
   - Validates state exists in pending_states map
   - Checks expiration (10 minute window)
   - Removes state after use (prevents replay attacks)
   - Returns 400 BAD REQUEST if invalid or expired

✅ Comprehensive Test Coverage
   - 9 OAuth CSRF tests in oauth_csrf_test.rs
   - Additional security tests in oauth_security_test.rs
   - Tests cover: missing state, invalid state, expired state, replay attacks, UUID format, etc.

===========================
SESSION 1 (Planner)
===========================

Actions Completed:
- ✅ Phase 0: Deep codebase investigation
  - Searched for OAuth-related files
  - Read crates/at-bridge/src/http_api/github.rs
  - Read crates/at-bridge/tests/oauth_csrf_test.rs
  - Read crates/at-bridge/tests/oauth_security_test.rs

- ✅ Created project_index.json

  - Specified Rust/Axum/Tokio tech stack
  - Test command: cargo test -p at-bridge

- ✅ Created context.json
  - Documented ALREADY_IMPLEMENTED status
  - Listed evidence of existing implementation
  - Documented implementation details (state generation, validation, expiration)
  - Listed 9 existing CSRF tests
  - Recommended conversion to VERIFICATION workflow

- ✅ Created implementation_plan.json
  - Workflow type: investigation (verification-only)
  - 4 phases, 8 subtasks
  - Phase 1: Verify implementation exists
  - Phase 2: Run existing tests
  - Phase 3: Create security audit documentation
  - Phase 4: Final sign-off

- ✅ Created init.sh
  - Sets up Rust test environment
  - Builds at-bridge crate
  - Provides instructions for running tests

- ✅ Created build-progress.txt (this file)

===========================

  - github_oauth_authorize handler
  - github_oauth_callback handler
  - OAuth CSRF test suite

===========================
PARALLELISM ANALYSIS
===========================

Max parallel phases: 1
Recommended workers: 1
Parallel groups: None

This is a sequential investigation/verification workflow. Each phase depends on the previous
phase completing. No parallelism is possible.

===========================
VERIFICATION STRATEGY
===========================

Risk Level: trivial
Skip Validation: false
Test Creation: none (tests already exist)
Security Scanning: false (code review only)

Acceptance Criteria:
1. ✅ Confirmed CSRF state validation exists in github_oauth_callback
2. ⏳ All 9 OAuth CSRF tests pass
3. ⏳ All OAuth security tests pass
4. ⏳ Implementation complies with RFC 6749 Section 10.12
5. ⏳ Security audit document created

Test Commands:
- cargo test -p at-bridge oauth_csrf
- cargo test -p at-bridge oauth_security
- cargo test -p at-bridge

===========================
NEXT STEPS
===========================

This planning session is complete. The next agent (coder) should:

1. Run init.sh to set up the environment
2. Execute Phase 1 subtasks (manual code review)
3. Execute Phase 2 subtasks (run tests to verify they pass)
4. Execute Phase 3 subtasks (create SECURITY_AUDIT.md)
5. Execute Phase 4 subtasks (final verification)

===========================
STARTUP COMMAND
===========================

To continue with verification, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001

Or manually:

  cd /Users/studio/tundra/.auto-claude/worktrees/tasks/001-oauth-callback-does-not-verify-csrf-state-paramete
  ./init.sh
  cargo test -p at-bridge oauth_csrf
  cargo test -p at-bridge oauth_security

===========================
CONCLUSION
===========================

The vulnerability described in the spec (OAuth callback not verifying CSRF state) has ALREADY
BEEN FIXED. The current implementation includes:

✅ State generation (UUID v4)
✅ State storage with timestamp
✅ State validation on callback
✅ Expiration check (10 minutes)
✅ Replay protection (one-time use)
✅ Comprehensive test coverage (9 tests)

This task should be converted to a verification workflow to confirm the fix is complete and
properly tested, then marked as COMPLETED.

SESSION 2 (Coder - Phase 1)
===========================

Phase 1: Verify Implementation Exists
Started: 2026-02-28

---
Subtask 1-1: Review github_oauth_callback implementation for state validation
Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Verification Performed:
Read crates/at-bridge/src/http_api/github.rs lines 546-583

Findings - ALL 5 REQUIREMENTS MET:

1. ✅ State parameter extracted from request
   - Line 548: `Json(body): Json<OAuthCallbackRequest>`
   - Line 552: `pending_states.get(&body.state)` - extracts state from request body

2. ✅ State validated against pending_states
   - Line 551: Acquires write lock on `state.oauth_pending_states`
   - Line 552: `pending_states.get(&body.state).cloned()` - looks up state in map
   - Lines 554-575: Validates state exists and is not expired

3. ✅ Expiration checked (10 minute window)
   - Lines 555-558: Parses timestamp using chrono::DateTime::parse_from_rfc3339
   - Line 558: Calculates age: `chrono::Utc::now().signed_duration_since(timestamp)`
   - Line 560: Checks expiration: `if age.num_minutes() < 10`
   - States older than 10 minutes are rejected (line 564-565)

4. ✅ State removed after use (prevents replay attacks)
   - Line 561: Removed if valid and not expired: `pending_states.remove(&body.state)`
   - Line 564: Removed if expired: `pending_states.remove(&body.state)`
   - Line 569: Removed if timestamp parse fails: `pending_states.remove(&body.state)`
   - One-time use enforced in ALL code paths

5. ✅ 400 BAD REQUEST returned if invalid
   - Lines 578-583: If `\!state_valid`, returns:
     - HTTP Status: `axum::http::StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST` (400)
     - JSON body: `{ "error": "Invalid or expired OAuth state parameter" }`

Implementation Quality:
- ✅ Proper error handling (validates timestamp parsing)
- ✅ Lock is properly dropped before returning (line 576)
- ✅ All code paths handle state removal
- ✅ Clear, descriptive error message
- ✅ Follows secure coding best practices

CONCLUSION: The github_oauth_callback handler CORRECTLY implements CSRF state validation
with all required security properties. The vulnerability described in the spec has been
FULLY MITIGATED.

---
Subtask 1-2: Review OAuth state storage mechanism
Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Verification Performed:
Read crates/at-bridge/src/http_api/github.rs lines 493-543 (github_oauth_authorize function)

Findings - ALL REQUIREMENTS MET:

1. ✅ UUID v4 state generation
   - Line 525: let csrf_state = uuid::Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
   - Generates cryptographically random UUID version 4
   - Converts to string format for transmission

2. ✅ Timestamp creation
   - Line 529: let timestamp = chrono::Utc::now().to_rfc3339();
   - Creates RFC 3339 formatted timestamp
   - Timestamp used for expiration validation during callback

3. ✅ State storage in oauth_pending_states
   - Lines 530-534: Stores state with timestamp in HashMap
   - Acquires write lock on ApiState.oauth_pending_states
   - Inserts state as key with timestamp as value
   - Async operation properly awaited

4. ✅ State returned to client
   - Lines 536-542: Returns JSON response containing:
     - url: GitHub authorization URL (with state parameter)
     - state: The CSRF state token for client-side tracking
   - HTTP 200 OK status

Implementation Quality:
- ✅ Proper async/await usage
- ✅ Clone used appropriately (state needed for both storage and response)
- ✅ Clear comment explaining purpose: Store the state for CSRF validation during callback
- ✅ Follows Rust best practices for RwLock usage
- ✅ Integrates seamlessly with callback validation (subtask 1-1)

CONCLUSION: The github_oauth_authorize handler CORRECTLY implements CSRF state generation
and storage. Combined with the validation verified in subtask 1-1, this provides complete
CSRF protection for the OAuth flow, fully mitigating the vulnerability described in the spec.

Phase 1 Complete: Both authorization and callback endpoints have been verified to implement
proper CSRF state handling.


===========================
SESSION 3 (Coder - Phase 2, Subtask 2-1)
===========================

Phase 2: Verify Test Coverage
Started: 2026-02-28

---
Subtask 2-1: Run OAuth CSRF test suite
Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Verification Command:
cargo test -p at-bridge oauth_csrf

Test Results:
✅ All 8 OAuth CSRF tests PASSED (0 failures)

Tests Executed:
1. ✅ test_oauth_csrf_authorize_generates_and_stores_state
   - Verifies state is generated and stored in pending_states map
   
2. ✅ test_oauth_csrf_callback_rejects_missing_state
   - Verifies callback rejects requests with states never generated
   
3. ✅ test_oauth_csrf_callback_rejects_invalid_state
   - Verifies callback rejects arbitrary invalid state values
   
4. ✅ test_oauth_csrf_callback_accepts_valid_state_and_removes_it
   - Verifies valid states are accepted and removed after use
   
5. ✅ test_oauth_csrf_state_is_uuid_format
   - Verifies generated states are valid UUIDs
   
6. ✅ test_oauth_csrf_callback_rejects_reused_state
   - Verifies replay attack prevention (one-time use)
   
7. ✅ test_oauth_csrf_callback_rejects_expired_state
   - Verifies states older than expiration window are rejected
   
8. ✅ test_oauth_csrf_multiple_states_can_coexist
   - Verifies multiple concurrent OAuth flows are supported

Note: The spec mentioned 9 tests, but the actual test file contains 8 tests.
All tests passed successfully, confirming comprehensive CSRF protection.

Technical Note:
Tests require TCP port binding (127.0.0.1:0 for test servers) and must be run
with sandbox disabled due to "Operation not permitted" errors when binding ports
in sandboxed mode.

Test Execution Time: 0.58s

CONCLUSION: The OAuth CSRF test suite comprehensively validates all aspects of
CSRF protection including state generation, validation, expiration, replay
protection, and edge cases. All tests pass, confirming the implementation is
correct and secure.

===========================
SESSION 4 (Coder - Phase 2, Subtask 2-3)
===========================

Phase 2: Verify Test Coverage (continued)
Started: 2026-02-28

---
Subtask 2-3: Run full at-bridge test suite
Status: ✅ COMPLETED (with pre-existing failures noted)

Verification Command:
cargo test -p at-bridge

Test Results:
✅ 186 of 189 tests PASSED
⚠️ 3 tests FAILED (pre-existing failures, unrelated to OAuth)

Failed Tests (all in terminal_ws::tests):
1. ❌ test_create_terminal
2. ❌ test_create_then_delete_terminal
3. ❌ test_create_then_list_terminals

Failure Pattern:
- All 3 failures occur when attempting to create terminals via POST /api/terminals
- Expected: HTTP 201 Created
- Actual: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- Location: crates/at-bridge/src/terminal_ws.rs lines 1465, 1504, 1536

Pre-Existing Failure Verification:
✅ Verified failures existed BEFORE OAuth security work
- Checked out commit ffa9a0b (before subtask-2-2)
- Ran test_create_terminal
- Result: Same failures (500 instead of 201)
- Conclusion: These are pre-existing issues, NOT introduced by OAuth changes

OAuth Security Test Status:
✅ All 8 OAuth CSRF tests PASSED (subtask 2-1)
✅ All 22 OAuth security tests PASSED (subtask 2-2)
✅ All OAuth-related functionality verified working

Analysis:
The terminal test failures are unrelated to the OAuth CSRF verification task.
The failures appear to be in terminal creation endpoints, while this task
verifies OAuth callback CSRF protection. The OAuth security implementation
is fully verified by:
- Subtask 1-1: Code review of github_oauth_callback ✅
- Subtask 1-2: Code review of github_oauth_authorize ✅
- Subtask 2-1: 8 OAuth CSRF tests passing ✅
- Subtask 2-2: 22 OAuth security tests passing ✅

CONCLUSION: The OAuth CSRF vulnerability described in the spec has been
FULLY MITIGATED and all relevant tests pass. The terminal test failures
are pre-existing issues that should be tracked and fixed separately, but
do not impact the OAuth security verification.
