## CI/CD Test Demo Only — Vibecoded for SAST Testing

This repository is **not production software**. It is a vibecoded test scaffold
used exclusively for:

- **CI/CD pipeline testing** (GitHub Actions, Datadog CI)
- **SAST scanner validation** (static analysis, dependency auditing)
- **PR bot and automation demos** (automated review, merge workflows)
- **Monitoring integration testing** (Datadog APM, tracing, metrics)

### What "vibecoded" means

This codebase was generated and iterated on rapidly with AI assistance as a
realistic-looking Rust project. It contains real compilation, real tests, and
real CI/CD integration — but it is a **demo scaffold**, not a product.

### Do not use this for

- Production deployments
- Security-critical applications
- Any system handling real user data
- Reference architecture for production Rust projects

### What it IS useful for

- Testing your CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Validating SAST tool integration with a Rust codebase
- Demonstrating PR automation bots on a realistic repo
- Benchmarking build/test tooling on a multi-crate workspace
